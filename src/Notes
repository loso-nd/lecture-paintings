!## App.js
- Parent file
- Renders components to the DOM
- Imports
    - painting data file to provide access to other {PaintingList} via props
    - {PaintingList} file where we get access to all of our paintings in order to create a single card for each painting from our data

    - {NavBar} file to render the to the DOM
Function component return
    - {NavBar} passing props in forms of attr [key="value"]
    - {PaintingsList} passing props in forms of attr [key="value"]

!##PaintingList
    ?- Responsiblity: 
    We want to display a painting Card for every painting in our data, By looking at the original painting arr, we already setup our paintings to have been passed down as props. For every item in our painting arr we want to render a painting card. Using map we can iterate thru our arr and return an arr of painting Cards. 

    ?- Imports
        - {PaintingCard} file is where we add the details for what we want to see on the card. Then import it here where each of those items are mapped into its own single card.

    ?function components return
        - We return a single {PaintingCard} and pass the painting.id, & paintings data into it to make them available to set up the structure of how we want the details passed to be displayed no the card. 

!##PaintingCard
        ?- Responsiblity: 
        Setting up the layout for the  details of the paintings. 
        
        
!Overview:
    ?{index.js} Top tier hierachy of all our components which renders the {App}

    ?- {App} 
    imports semantic-ui, paintings data, {paintingsList} and {NavBar} which are both dynamically inserted components. Both components are passed props which allows us to access them via props inside the designated component. Dynamically adding components here are returned to be display to the DOM

        Then...

    ?- {NavBar} 
    A fucntional component now has access to the props passed into it from the {App}. We can access those props, via [ props.key ]. Recall passing props means that we use [key = "value" ]

       Then...         

    ?- {PaintingList} 
    functional compponent, imports {PaintingCard}, executes a map on the PaintingsList arr. This arr is only avaialble bc the paintings data was passed as props into the dynamic component from {App}. For each item in that arr it {PaintingList} will return a single {PaintingCard}. We pass in the following key={painting.id}, painting={painting} as props to be used later inside {PaintingCard}. Since the details that we want to be displayed on on {PaintingCard} will not be avaiable unless we pass the dynamic component props.

    !NOTE - PaintingsList is the name of the key we used to represent our arr

        
    ?- {PaintingCard} 
    At this point {PaintingCard} has access to all the details of the of the paintslist arr and we return those details in a <div> by callig [ props.key]
